Instrument integration Python software for microscopy.

## Motivation

State-of-the-art optical microscopy requires coordinated control of several instruments: cameras, photodetectors, lasers, shutters, etc., which is typically achieved via custom routines running on a PC and AD/DA converters. Currently, the most popular environment for instrument control has proprietary and closed software. However, in the last years, there has been a growing interest in Python. Instrumentation could benefit from the language because it is cross-platform, free, open-source and also because there is a massive set of ready-to-use high-level libraries, including key libraries for machine learning and deep learning methods.
